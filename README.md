This dataset contains 284,807 anonymized credit card transactions with three fields: Time (seconds since first transaction), Amount (transaction value), and Class (0 = normal, 1 = fraud). Fraudulent cases make up less than 0.2%, making it useful for anomaly detection and machine learning fraud prediction.

# Executive Summary

The credit card fraud detection dataset contains 284,807 anonymized transactions, each with details on transaction time, amount, and classification as fraudulent or legitimate. Fraudulent transactions account for less than 0.2% of the data, highlighting the extreme imbalance that makes fraud detection a complex challenge.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for analyzing transaction behavior, identifying unusual spending patterns, and building predictive models for fraud detection. Its size and imbalance closely mirror real-world scenarios, making it an ideal benchmark for testing the effectiveness of anomaly detection and machine learning algorithms.
